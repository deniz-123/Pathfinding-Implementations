# Pathfinding-Implementations
Implementation of bunch of algorithms and visualizing them

# Date : 7/28/2020
# Version : 1.0.0
Published first time the implementations of some algorithms and their visualization

# Date : 7/30/2020
# Version : 1.0.1
Solved some bugs for while finding shortest path in dijkstra's algorithm when there are weighted nodes

# Date : 8/5/2020
# Version : 1.0.2
Added multiple end nodes so that algorithm can find the best paths between multiple spots.
Now while creating the maze, current node is marked as pink so user can see clearly what is happening

# Date : 8/8/2020
# Version : 1.0.3
Added Prim's algorithm. 
Now user can create maze with Prim's by clickin p button.

# Date : 8/14/2020
# Version : 1.0.4
Optimization and bug fixes for maze creation algorithms

# Date : 8/21/2020
# Version : 1.0.5
Optimized the files and code
Added depth first search and breadth-first search algorithms

# Date: 8/22/2020
# Version : 1.0.6
Fixed bugs for dfs and bfs while finding a path for maze
Added Greedy Best First Search algorithm

# Date : 9/12/2020
# Version : 1.0.7
Fixed bugs for gbfs
Added Hunt and Kill and Kruskal's algorithms for maze creation
