# Pathfinding-Implementations
Implementation of bunch of algorithms and visualizing them

# Date : 7/28/2020
# Version : 1.0.0
Published first time the implementations of some algorithms and their visualization

# Date : 7/30/2020
# Version : 1.0.1
Solved some bugs for while finding shortest path in dijkstra's algorithm when there are weighted nodes

# Date : 8/5/2020
# Version : 1.0.1
Added multiple end nodes so that algorithm can find the best paths between multiple spots.
Now while creating the maze, current node is marked as pink so user can see clearly what is happening
